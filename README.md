Hi! This is a very basic Web App created just for my portfolio so far. It's built as a basic "farm management app", and by now, it includes the following features :

  - Create an account.
  - Save your land plots coordinates using a map. 
  - Keep information about your land plots.
  - Save your tasks.
  - Check the weather in your location. 
  - Update and Delete all your information. 

I've used some Javascript Technologies like Node.js and Passport.js, MongoDB as my database and some APIs like Leaflet with OpenStreetMap and OpenWeather, allowing the user to perform CRUD operations in a MVC pattern.  

As I said, it's still a basic app but I'm planning to scale it and add more features soon, like a calendar, display plots on the map, or sending emails to retrieve your password for instance...

Anyway...Thanks for your time!

Isaac
